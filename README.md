2. [Retrieve Intregation ID, Region & Service Instance ID from the Watson Assisnt service and add it to index.html](#2-retrieve-Intregation-ID-Region-&-Service-Instance-ID-from-the-Watson-Assisnt-service).
3. [Run the server](#3-run-the-server).
4. [Run the mobile application](#4-run-the-mobile-application).

### 1. Set up an instance of Watson Assistant

Log in to IBM Cloud and provision a Watson Assistant instance.

1. Provision an instance of **Watson Assistant** from the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant).
1. Launch the Watson Assistant service.
1. [Create an **Assistant**](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-add).

4. From a terminal:
    1. Go to the `starter-kit/server-app` directory of the cloned repo.
    2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
    3. Launch the server application locally or deploy to IBM Cloud:
        - To run locally:
            1. Start the application: `npm start`.
            2. The server can be accessed at http://localhost:3000.
        - To deploy to IBM Cloud:
            1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account using the IBM Cloud CLI: `ibmcloud login`.
            2. Target a Cloud Foundry org and space: `ibmcloud target --cf`.
            3. Push the app to IBM Cloud: `ibmcloud app push`.
